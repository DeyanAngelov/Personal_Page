                                        I enjoy reading since I was a small kid, some of my
                                        happiest memories are connected with speed reading
                                        an interesting book. Its by far my oldest hobby, if one
                                        could even call reading a hobby. Here I will list some of my favorite
                                        authors that are more wildly popular:
                                    </span>
                                    <span>
                                        <span class="author">J.R.R. Tolkien</span>, I just love <img src="images/lotr.png" alt="The Lord of the Rings image title"/>
                                        and everything Middle Earth. Tolkien is just the best
                                        and everyone else in the genre, is just walking in his footsteps. Every other
                                        fantasy story is pretty much majored to The Lord, but none
                                        has yet reached its glory.
                                    </span>
                                    <hr>
                                    <span>
                                        <span class="author">Frank Herbert</span> is another big favorite of mine. I think
                                        <img src="images/dune.png" alt="The Dune saga image title"> is by far the best Sci Fi
                                        book ever made. Dune is for the Sci Fi genre, what
                                        The Lord of the Rings is for the Fantasy genre and I cant think of a bigger compliment then that.
                                        The ideas of Frank Herbert are just wayyyyyyyy ahead of his time and even today
                                        they are still mind blowing.

                                    <span>
                                        <span class="author">Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</span> and his <img src="images/sherlock.png" alt="Sherlock Homes image title"/>
                                        holds a very special place in my hearth, as The Hound of the Baskervilles
                                        was one of the first serious books I've read at the age of 8
                                        (for the first time at least).
                                        Ever since I have been fascinated by the use of logic and deduction of
                                        Mr Sherlock Homes. Soon after I finished everything else written
                                        about the Greatest Detective, the other 3 major story books and every short story I
                                        could find (to my knowledge I've read them all but I could be wrong).

                                        Another hobby of mine is PC gaming. I started playing when I
                                        was around 10 years old, with few friends of mine. We played
                                        turn-based strategies, shooters and later, real-time strategies.
                                        Those were the days of my teen years with long LAN days and nights.
                                        Sadly they are all now a thing of the past and today I play more or
                                        less only 3 games:
                                    </span>
                                    <span>
                                        The first game I ever played and that I will probably play forever is
                                        <img src="images/h3_logo.png" alt="Heroes 3 of Might and Magic logo"/> Heroes 3 for me is the immortal game,
                                        I have few friends with whom, even today we group up and play on one PC.
                                        Sadly today is hard to find time when all of us are free for a big, long,
                                        proper Heroes game, but this does not stop us.

                                        The game that I play the most for the past 7-8 years is
                                        <img src="images/wow.png" alt="World of Warcraft logo"/> I am a big fan of the Warcraft universe
                                        since the times of Warcraft 2. So when WoW came out it was only
                                        a meter of time till I started playing. I have been in a really nice
                                        guild for the last 5 years, we are called <a href="http://www.thehungeringcold.net/">The Hungering cold</a>
                                        and the name of my character is <a href="http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/character/defias-brotherhood/Xaav/simple">Xaav</a>.

                                        The last game I play from time to time is <img src="images/d3.png" alt="Diablo 3 logo"/> I started
                                        playing Diablo 3 when it first came out mainly because of the RMAH
                                        (Real Money Auction House) and it did play off. After the release of RoS
                                        and the end of RMAH, I continued to play the game because after the changes
                                        that were made to it, I found it to be quite fun as just a solo RPG game.

                                        Last but not least comes the time I spend with my 4 legged friend
                                        Jack. This is by no means a hobby, but for the lack of a better word I will call it one.
                                        He is a 4 and a half years old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_%28dog_breed%29">english pointer</a>,
                                        who enjoys eating my shoes and stealing what ever is inside the washing machine,
                                        when no one is looking his way.
                                        I love spending time with him, playing or taking long walks,
                                        when possible, in the park or in the forests above Pernik's stadium.
