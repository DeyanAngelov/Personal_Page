# Thank You for viewing my project!

I am uploading this very first stand-alone project to GitHub, so that anyone interested can view my code and provide feedback.
The website is still work in progress and there are many things I wish to improve and to add. There is still work to be done 
on the media queries (many elements need resizing). Also I wish to add some kind of comment section so that visitors can leave
comments.

And most importantly, I wish to collect  feedback on the quality of my code. Is it readable? do I need to include more comments?
Am I generaly grouping the code correctly (CSS)? Do I make any mistakes and how to prevent them? I have clearly still much to 
learn (inlcuding about the proper usage of GitHub) but I hope that with your help I will improve.

Thank you very much for taking the time to see what I have done, I hope that it doesnt look too bad and again ALL and any kind
of feedback is more then welcome.
