                So from where to start?
            </p>

            <span> My name is Deyan, I am 25 years old from Pernik Bulgaria,
                I went to <a href="http://pgi-pernik.bg-schools.com/">the Professional High School of Economics</a> in Pernik
                and later to <a href="http://www.swu.bg/">the South-West University "Neofit Rilski"</a> in Blagoevgrad.
            </span>

            <span> Last May (2014) I started as a student in <a href="http://students.infostart.eu/">InfoStart</a>,
                a program made by Information Services (Информационно Обслужване) for IT education and now I have
                finished it successfully with a diploma from the Ministry of Education (МОН).
                I watched many different videos and tutorials since then and I continue to do so till this very day.
                I like the video and demo materials published by <a href="https://softuni.bg/">SoftUni</a>,
                my humble opinion is that the efforts of Svetlin Nakov and his team deserves admiration.
                From SoftUni for example, I did all the homework tasks in their <a href="https://softuni.bg/trainings/1087/Web-Fundamentals-HTML-CSS-Feb-2015">Web Fundamentals course</a>
                and at the moment I am doing the same with the <a href="https://softuni.bg/trainings/coursesinstances/details/1101">JavaScript Basics</a> course.
                From everything I learned and came across so far in the big WWW
                world, I enjoy the most HTML5/CSS3, JS and PHP. Of course I have
                still much to learn (especially about JS and PHP but for now I want
                to focus on JS) but I am really eager to do so.
            </span>
            <span>
                So this is it pretty much in few words, if you want to learn
                more about me (and marvel at the glory of my website a little more)
                you can go and take a look at my <a href="Hobbies.html">Hobbies!</a>

            <p>
                The Website is still work in progress. The plan is to
                have at least 4 major resolution break-points, optimized
                for: Chrome, Firefox and IE 10 (I hope).
